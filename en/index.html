# Welcome

I would like to welcome you to my personal website, that I use both to promote myself as a consultant and also as a database. Details about the projects I have done so far can be found [here][projects].

# What can I do?

If you want to know more about the services I offer, I have divided them in three different categories, so please check [undergraduate students][undergrad], [research cooperation][research] and [companies][companies].

# Why to use Mathematics?

Any process has an underlying mathematical description that can be brought to the surface to:

* Understand the process;
* Infer objective conclusions;
* Study optimality;
* Apply the model for different purposes.

And what we get out of it is:

* Reduced costs and increased profitability;
* Generalization: more results with less effort.

# What can be done with Mathematics?

The fields that are covered by Mathematics are several and they go from abstract areas such as set theory or number theory to very applied fields as fluid dynamics or finance. An easy way of picturing how mathematics is present in nowadays science is shown on the following diagram
