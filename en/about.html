[me]: [[!!img/me.jpg]] "Me"

 My name is Marc Puche Niubó and I am from Barcelona, Spain. For simplicity I decided to use only my first surname. I was born in April 1990 and I liked mathematics ever since I can remember. After middle school I decided to specialize in natural sciences during my high school years, immersing myself into Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

When having to decide what I wanted to study, I found out about a new Bachelor's program, a double degree in Physics and Mathematics at the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona][uab]. I got accepted, starting September 2008. My interest for Applied Mathematics brought me to do my Bachelor thesis on something I had not done during my years at college, so I decided to take a glance at the world of Financial Mathematics and did my thesis on the Black-Scholes model for European options on two assets.

In July 2013 I was done with my undergraduate studies and decided to look for something new and challenging, so I decided to relocate in Hamburg, Germany, in order to learn German language, find a job and perhaps continue with my studies there. In September 2013 I settled down and started working at SANDEMANs New Europe GmbH, while learning German intensively. In December, that same year I applied to the master's degree in Mathematics at the Universität Hamburg and got accepted, starting with the summer semester in April 2014.

After two years at SNE and having gathered a lot of experience, and being about to write my master thesis, I decided to try again something different and started working as a tutor teaching problems of a subject of Mathematics for Physicists at the [Universität Hamburg][uh].

In January 2016 following my personal interest in Fluid Dynamics I contacted Dr. Mellado at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, who hired me as a scientific assistant in the department of Atmosphere and Turbulent Mixing Processes, where we work in the field of turbulence in the convective boundary layer.

Up to now, I am deriving results to recover the moisture scalar field by using a linear convination of the buoyancy and a second passive scalar field. Moreover, I continue making progress with my master thesis in the field of Applied Functional Analysis, on the topic of input-output differential-algebraic systems.
